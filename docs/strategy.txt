Health
Mission: Progress research and innovation in the
prevention and management of cardiometabolic
and infectious diseases, regenerative medicine, and
equitable health outcomes

novo nordisk foundation - strategy 2030

Cardiometabolic and infectious
diseases are major and growing
global challenges associated with
excess but preventable mortality.
The two morbidities interact, and
this is exasperated by climate
change. In addition, current medical
practices often do not result in
equitable health outcomes for
people living with these diseases.
Supporting biomedical and clinical
science with a particular focus on
diabetes and its comorbidities has been
part of the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s
mission for the last century. Building
on this legacy, the Foundation will
in the coming decade expand its
scope and increase its support for
research concerning the prevention
and treatment of cardiometabolic
diseases (CMDs): obesity, diabetes
and cardiovascular disease, and
the consequences of this cluster of
common and complex diseases.
Even though considerable progress
has been made in understanding
the aetiology and treatment effects
of these conditions in recent
years, there is still more to do to
improve patient-centricity and the
effectiveness of novel interventions.
For many of them, preventing
them from developing in the first
place is the best way of dealing
with them. The Foundation will
support new ways of understanding,
diagnosing, preventing, and treating
these diseases in a translational
network between basic and clinical
scientists, involving a wide range
of competencies, methodologies,

and technologies. The evolving
discipline of precision medicine
is an approach that holds great
promise in promoting safer and
more efficacious, equitable and
cost-effective solutions for the
individual and society. This will
require collaboration across a broad
range of stakeholders, including
e.g. universities, the public health
system, private sector, and people
living with disease.
The rapid spread of Covid-19
across the globe highlighted the
consequences of insufficient
preparedness for dealing with
emerging new pathogens capable
of causing significant morbidity
and mortality. The risk of future
pandemics is high and, at the
same time, the looming crisis of
antimicrobial resistance points to the
pressing need for the development
of novel diagnostics, preventatives,
and therapeutics. The Foundation
will seek to strengthen and deepen
the analytical, technological, and
pharmacological armamentarium
against pathogens, and work together
with key stakeholders to support
research and development within the
prevention and treatment of infectious
diseases to help ensure we are better
prepared for tackling future pandemics.
In addition, there are important
interactions between cardiometabolic
and infectious diseases, both regarding
susceptibility and severity, not least in
the face of climate change and global
warming, and thus an urgent need to
address these issues from a scientific
point of view.

Alongside cardiometabolic
and infectious diseases, novel
innovative medicines, treatments,
and technologies such as artificial
intelligence and quantum computing
are emerging. One such area with
major advancements and a broad
potential, ranging from disease
understanding and cure for chronic
conditions to drug development,
is regenerative medicine: e.g. stem
cell-based science and therapies. The
Foundation will continue supporting
this area to create a seamless and
productive value chain from basic
discoveries to clinical implementation.
Inequity in health is a persisting global
problem that exacerbates existing
disease burdens, posing a threat not
only to individuals and healthcare
systems, but also to the social
cohesion of societies. Addressing
inequity in health will be a crosscutting theme for the Foundation
in our support of health-promoting
interventions and both intended
and unintended consequences will
be considered. Working to reduce
inequities is multi-facetted and the
Foundation will support both targeted
interventions towards groups at risk
and universal improvements. It is our
ambition to fight inequity in health in
Denmark as well as globally, where
the focus will be on low- and middleincome countries. A growing ability to
leverage data, drive the development
of disruptive technologies and connect
with patients and consumers will spur
the development and implementation
of more prepared, evidence-based,
and equitable healthcare systems.

Sustainability
Mission: Advance knowledge and solutions to support
the green transition in society

novo nordisk foundation - strategy 2030

Combatting climate change and
producing healthy and nutritious
food to a growing world population
without exhausting our planet’s
resources are two of the biggest
challenges for society today. We
need sustainable technologies and
methods to improve our current
food systems and use of land for
agriculture.

development effort is required,
covering both basic food science
and -production as well as a better
understanding of what guides
behavioural changes and dietary
preferences. A dietary shift also
includes focus on a healthy diet
improving human health and
preventing non-communicable
diseases.

Over the next decade, the Foundation
will support the green transition
in society by advancing research
and innovation within sustainable
agriculture, development of better
food systems and climate change
mitigation with a focus on carbon
capture, utilisation and storage.

Up to one third of all food is lost postharvest. Reducing this waste will have
a huge impact on the sustainability of
food systems and ultimately planetary
health. Research and activities aiming
at reducing food production loss will
be part of the Foundation’s initiatives.

A central approach is to better
understand and utilise the complex
biological systems making up
agro-ecosystems in agriculture.
This entails supporting relevant
research disciplines, e.g. crop
genetics, data science, ecosystem
biology, microbiology and robotics,
as well as the development of new
technologies and management
practises. Crops and fields may in the
future provide both climate change
mitigation and meet demands for
plant-based food as well as better
land use that benefits biodiversity.
To feed a growing global population
in a sustainable way, livestockbased proteins must increasingly
be replaced by proteins from, e.g.
plants and fermentation processes.
A large and focused research and

Reducing greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere
is key to mitigating global climate
change. This is a formidable
challenge which is unlikely to be
solved by a single technology
but requires a concerted effort
combining several technologies,
ranging from capturing CO2 or
methane at concentrated point
sources to developing low-carbon
alternatives to high-emitting
industrial processes such as
cement production. Many of these
technologies, spanning biology,
chemistry and physics, hold
large potential but are still at an
experimental level and will require
significant research and translational
efforts to mature.
The green transition requires a global
effort from many stakeholders. The

challenges are among the biggest
ever faced by human society, yet they
can be met. A successful outcome
will not only require research in core
scientific disciplines, but also includes
the social sciences and humanities,
as well as involving participation
in the public debate, dialogue with
the political system and supporting
societal competencies through
training and education.
For the Foundation, many
initiatives will be mission-driven,
focusing on a specific goal of
knowledge or technology spanning
various scientific disciplines and
methodologies. A better fundamental
understanding and use of biology will
be key in many of the Foundation’s
future research initiatives.
The Foundation’s initiatives within
sustainability will connect research
and innovation across academia and
industry, seeking a close and deep
collaboration. By combining research
outcomes with the investment
activities of Novo Holdings when
technologies are ready to scale
and the markets are prepared, the
Foundation has a unique opportunity
to create an unparalleled impact.

The Life
Science
Ecosystem
Mission: Invest in scientific research, education and
innovation to enable a world class life science ecosystem

novo nordisk foundation - strategy 2030

It has been a part of the heritage
of the Novo Nordisk Foundation
for almost a century to support
fundamental research and the
development of novel technologies
that have the potential to benefit
people and society. Building on
this legacy, the Foundation aims
to increase its support for building
an ecosystem that is needed for
excelling within the life science and
sustainability areas, and to help
solve some of the major challenges
facing us in the future.
We see a life science ecosystem
as a dynamic entity consisting of
many different interdependent
components. It covers fundamental
research and innovation within
medical sciences, life sciences
and natural and technical
sciences. It includes technological
advancements and infrastructure
that can be used by researchers
to advance discoveries. It covers
education of people from basic
school to university level in a society
that values science. It also involves
the development of systems that can
help innovative research and ideas
to be brought into market, creating
new start-ups and economic growth.
Diversity and creativity will be
prioritised as crucial components in
a well-functioning ecosystem; both
are essential for creating a vivid and
robust ecosystem capable of offering
solutions to societal challenges.
Fundamental research can
provide the basis of knowledge
that drives societal progress. It

fosters ideas, which generates new
insights, discoveries, innovation
and technological development,
which in turn may lead to solutions,
products and further insights,
providing value for society.
The Foundation will over the next
decade support both curiositydriven research and research that
is translational or mission-driven,
often with an interdisciplinary
approach. This can be in areas
such as data and material sciences,
AI, genomics, robotics, quantum
technologies, microbiome and
systems biology to mention a
few. And we will help establish
collaborations between Danish and
international research groups at
universities to foster a world class
scientific environment supporting
the life science ecosystem.
High quality education is
instrumental for training the
workforce of tomorrow, for
educating the next generation of
researchers and for raising the
awareness of science. In the coming
years, the Foundation will continue
to support the advancement of
the science capital in Denmark by
strengthening formal, as well as
informal education at all levels.
It is our ambition to help create
a world-leading innovation
environment in Denmark to drive
transformation of science-based
discoveries within life science and
the green transition into solutions

benefitting the health of people and
sustainability of society.
This will require collaboration with
a broad range of stakeholders,
national and international, in the
public sector, policy making, the
funding and investment sectors, as
well as industry.
